# Project Brief: 2MB Documentation Website

## Project Overview
**Name:** 2MB: Modes-based Memory Bank Agentic Workflow Documentation Site  
**Tagline:** "Modes-based Memory Bank Agentic Workflow"  
**Type:** Educational tutorial and documentation website built with Docusaurus

## Core Mission
This documentation website serves as a comprehensive tutorial and guide for the **2MB (Modes-based Memory Bank) framework** - an innovative approach to AI-assisted software development that enables AI agents to handle complex coding tasks methodically and efficiently through persistent memory and structured operational modes.

## Target Audience
- **Tech enthusiasts** interested in AI-assisted development workflows
- **AI practitioners** looking to improve their coding productivity
- **Software developers** wanting to adopt systematic AI collaboration practices
- **Cursor IDE users** seeking advanced workflow optimization
- **Anyone** interested in structured approaches to complex software development

## Primary Objectives
1. **Enable practical adoption:** Guide visitors to successfully set up and use the 2MB framework in their own projects
2. **Promote Cursor IDE integration:** Help users adopt these practices specifically within Cursor IDE
3. **Provide comprehensive education:** Offer both accessible introductions and deep technical implementation details
4. **Demonstrate real-world value:** Showcase practical examples, case studies, and step-by-step tutorials
5. **Bridge theory and practice:** Complement existing .mdc rule files with user-friendly documentation

## Content Strategy
- **Replace Docusaurus boilerplate** with 2MB framework-specific content
- **Mode-specific documentation:** Dedicated pages for each operational mode (INIT, DOC, PLAN, CREATIVE, IMPLEMENT, REFLECT)
- **Practical tutorials:** Step-by-step guides showing the workflow in action
- **Real examples:** Case studies and practical demonstrations
- **Technical integration:** Serve existing .mdc rule files as documentation articles
- **Progressive learning:** From accessible introductions to detailed technical implementation

## Technical Implementation
- **Platform:** Docusaurus v3.8.0 with TypeScript and React
- **Dual-purpose architecture:** Both educational content and technical rule documentation
- **Integration approach:** .mdc rule files served as Docusaurus documentation
- **Target setup:** Optimized for Cursor IDE implementation

## Expected Outcomes
Visitors will leave with:
- Clear understanding of the 2MB framework concepts and benefits
- Practical knowledge to implement the workflow in their projects
- Confidence using structured AI-assisted development practices
- Specific skills for Cursor IDE integration
- Access to both high-level concepts and detailed technical specifications

## Value Proposition
This site bridges the gap between innovative AI workflow theory and practical implementation, providing the tech community with a proven, systematic approach to AI-assisted software development that transforms complex coding challenges into manageable, structured processes.
