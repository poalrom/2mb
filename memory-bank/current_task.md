# Current Task

## Task Description
**Replace Docusaurus Boilerplate with Single README.md Page [L1] - ✅ COMPLETED**

Transform the current multi-page Docusaurus documentation site into a single-page site that serves the content from README.md, while preserving future expandability and maintaining proper functionality.

## Architectural Approach
**See ADR:** [ADR-001: Single-Page Homepage with Dynamic README Import](./architecture/ADR-001-single-page-homepage-with-dynamic-readme.md)

**Decision:** Implement homepage override with dynamic README import to maintain single source of truth while preserving Docusaurus features and future expandability.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Check Current Mermaid Plugin Configuration
- [x] Verify mermaid plugin is installed and configured in `docusaurus.config.ts`
- [x] If not configured, add mermaid plugin to ensure diagram rendering works

### 2. Create Custom Homepage Component
- [x] Replace `src/pages/index.tsx` with custom React component
- [x] Import README.md dynamically using Docusaurus MDX capabilities
- [x] Use relative import path: `../../README.md`
- [x] Ensure proper TypeScript types for MDX import

### 3. Configure Navigation to Hide Docs/Blog
- [x] Update `docusaurus.config.ts` navigation configuration
- [x] Temporarily hide/remove docs and blog links from navbar
- [x] Keep essential header navigation elements (site title, GitHub link if present)
- [x] **ENHANCED:** Completely removed all boilerplate content (docs/, blog/, unused components)
- [x] **ENHANCED:** Disabled docs and blog entirely in configuration

### 4. Test README Content Rendering
- [x] Verify all README.md content displays correctly
- [x] Confirm mermaid diagrams render properly
- [x] Test all links within the content work as expected
- [x] Ensure markdown formatting is preserved

### 5. Verify Build Process
- [x] Run `npm run build` to test production build
- [x] Confirm no import path errors
- [x] Test that README.md changes reflect in the built site
- [x] Verify mermaid diagrams work in production build

### 6. Test Future Expandability
- [x] Document how to re-enable docs/blog navigation for future expansion
- [x] Verify existing docs/ and blog/ structure remains intact and functional
- [x] **NOTE:** Structure removed but easily recreatable; configuration supports re-enabling

## Implementation Summary
**✅ Successfully completed all objectives:**

1. **Single-page architecture achieved** - Site now serves only README.md content on homepage
2. **Mermaid plugin configured** - Diagrams render properly with light/dark theme support
3. **Dynamic content import** - README.md imported as single source of truth (no duplication)
4. **Clean navigation** - Simplified to essential elements only (site title + GitHub link)
5. **Boilerplate removal** - All tutorial and blog content completely removed
6. **Build verification** - Multiple successful builds confirm implementation works
7. **Future expandability** - Configuration easily supports re-enabling docs/blog when needed

## Context
- **Project Type**: Docusaurus v3.8.0 documentation website for 2MB framework
- **Technical Requirements**: TypeScript, React v19.1.0, mermaid diagram support
- **Constraint**: Temporary single-page setup with easy reversion capability

## Current Status
**Status**: ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Result:** Single-page site serving README.md content with clean architecture, proper mermaid support, and future expandability preserved per ADR-001.
