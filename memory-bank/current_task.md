# Current Task

## Task Description
**Implement markdown parsing for rules [L1]**

Enhance the existing `processMarkdown` method in `plugins/docusaurus-plugin-mdc-rules/src/content-loader.ts` to implement proper remark/rehype processing that transforms markdown to HTML using Docusaurus's built-in markdown processing capabilities.

## Background
The current plugin implementation has a TODO comment in the `processMarkdown` method:
```typescript
// TODO: Implement remark processing once ES module issues are resolved
// or when used within Docusaurus context where module resolution works properly
```

Currently, the method simply returns raw markdown content without transformation, but it should process the markdown into HTML for proper rendering.

## Requirements
- **Use Remark/Rehype Pipeline**: Use `remark` with `remark-rehype` and `rehype-stringify` for markdown processing
- **GFM and Mermaid**: Support will come automatically from remark-gfm plugin (can be added later)
- **HTML Output**: Generate HTML output for the current `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` approach
- **Minimal Testing**: One test case to verify parsing works (Docusaurus already tests markdown features)

## Technical Context
- **Location**: `plugins/docusaurus-plugin-mdc-rules/src/content-loader.ts` - `processMarkdown` method (line ~215)
- **Current State**: Method returns content as-is without processing
- **Integration Point**: Method is called during file processing before content is stored in `RuleContent` objects
- **Output Format**: HTML string that will be used in `<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: markdownContent }} />`

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Research MDX Loader Integration
- [x] **Study `@docusaurus/mdx-loader` usage**:
   - Research how to use MDX loader programmatically within a plugin
   - Check MDX loader API and configuration options
   - Understand how to access Docusaurus site configuration for MDX processing

- [x] **Identify integration approach**:
   - Determine how to create MDX loader instance within plugin context
   - Check if site configuration needs to be passed to loader
   - Understand how to get HTML output from MDX processing

**RESEARCH FINDINGS**: Using MDX loader directly is overly complex. Better approach is to use remark + remark-rehype + rehype-stringify pipeline which is simpler and more appropriate for this use case.

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
- [x] **Add remark processing dependencies**:
   - Add `remark-rehype` to plugin dependencies (remark already available)
   - Add `rehype-stringify` for HTML output
   - Ensure compatibility with current remark version (15.0.1)
   - Update plugin's `package.json` with required dependencies

### Step 3: Implement Markdown Processing
- [x] **Update `processMarkdown` method**:
   - Replace current TODO implementation with remark/rehype processing
   - Create remark processor with remark-rehype and rehype-stringify
   - Process markdown content through unified processor
   - Handle async processing properly
   - Implement error handling for malformed markdown
   - Ensure output is HTML string suitable for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

### Step 4: Basic Testing
- [x] **Single test case**:
   - Create one test to verify remark markdown-to-HTML processing works
   - Test with basic markdown content (headings, paragraphs, code blocks)
   - Verify output is valid HTML string

### Step 5: Documentation Update
- [x] **Update plugin documentation**:
   - Document that markdown processing now uses remark/rehype pipeline
   - Note that GFM and other features can be added via remark plugins
   - Update development guidelines

## Expected Outcomes
- Markdown content in `.mdc` files is properly processed to HTML using remark/rehype capabilities
- GFM and other features can be added later through remark plugins
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Performance impact is minimal

## Definition of Done
- [x] `processMarkdown` method implements markdown-to-HTML transformation using remark/rehype
- [x] One test case verifies parsing works correctly
- [x] Documentation is updated with new capabilities

## Current Status
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - All steps completed successfully

**Next Action**: Task completed. The markdown parsing functionality has been successfully implemented with remark/rehype pipeline, tested, and documented.
