# Current Task

## Task Description
**Implement GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) support [L1]**

Enhance the existing `processMarkdown` method in `plugins/docusaurus-plugin-mdc-rules/src/content-loader.ts` to add GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) support using the already installed `remark-gfm` plugin.

## Background
The current plugin implementation uses a basic remark/rehype pipeline for markdown processing but doesn't include GFM features like:
- Tables
- Strikethrough text
- Task lists (checkboxes)
- Autolinks
- Footnotes

The `remark-gfm` plugin is already installed as a dependency (version 4.0.1) but not being used in the processing pipeline.

## Requirements
- **Add GFM Support**: Use the existing `remark-gfm` plugin in the remark processing pipeline
- **Maintain HTML Output**: Continue generating HTML output for the current `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` approach
- **Test GFM Features**: Verify that common GFM features (tables, strikethrough, task lists) work correctly
- **No Breaking Changes**: Ensure all existing functionality remains intact

## Technical Context
- **Location**: `plugins/docusaurus-plugin-mdc-rules/src/content-loader.ts` - `processMarkdown` method (around line 208)
- **Current State**: Basic remark + remark-rehype + rehype-stringify pipeline without GFM
- **Available Dependency**: `remark-gfm` v4.0.1 already installed
- **Integration Point**: Method is called during file processing before content is stored in `RuleContent` objects
- **Output Format**: HTML string that will be used in `<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: markdownContent }} />`

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add GFM Plugin to Remark Pipeline
- [x] **Import remark-gfm plugin**:
   - Add import statement for `remark-gfm` at the top of the file
   - Ensure proper TypeScript types are available

- [x] **Integrate plugin into processing pipeline**:
   - Add `.use(remarkGfm)` to the unified processor chain
   - Position it correctly in the pipeline (after remarkParse, before remarkRehype)
   - Ensure compatibility with existing remark-rehype processing

### Step 2: Test GFM Features
- [ ] **Create comprehensive test cases**:
   - Test markdown tables
   - Test strikethrough text (`~~text~~`)
   - Test task lists (`- [x] completed`, `- [ ] incomplete`)
   - Test autolinks (URLs that are automatically linked)
   - Verify output generates proper HTML for each feature

### Step 3: Update Documentation
- [ ] **Update plugin documentation**:
   - Document that GFM features are now supported
   - List specific GFM features that are available
   - Add examples of GFM usage in `.mdc` files

## Expected Outcomes
- All GitHub Flavored Markdown features work correctly in `.mdc` files
- Tables, strikethrough, task lists, and autolinks render properly as HTML
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Performance impact is minimal (plugin is already installed)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `processMarkdown` method includes `remark-gfm` plugin in processing pipeline
- [ ] Test cases verify all major GFM features work correctly
- [ ] Documentation is updated with GFM capabilities
- [ ] No regression in existing markdown processing functionality

## Current Status
**Status**: ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS** - Ready to implement GFM support

**Next Action**: Add `remark-gfm` to the processing pipeline in the `processMarkdown` method.
