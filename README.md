# 2MB: Modes-based Memory Bank Agentic Workflow

## Introduction

The primary goal of this framework is to enable the agent to handle complex coding tasks methodically and efficiently by leveraging a persistent "Memory Bank" and operating in distinct "Modes".

These rules are intended to be used by an AI agent, potentially within an AI-first development environment like the Cursor IDE, or as a blueprint for a custom AI coding assistant.
